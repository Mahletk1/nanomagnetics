        <h1 style="clear:both; margin-top:100px;">The History of Nanodots</h1>
        <p>Round magnets are nothing new. In fact, they've been around since the ancient Greeks discovered magnetite.
          Despite the amazing magnetic discoveries that took place during the Golden Age of Magnetism (the 1800s),
          nobody thought to use magnets as the tactile Nanodot gizmo we love today.</p>
        <p>In 1982, the discovery of Neodymium Nd2Fe14B revolutionized magnets by increasing their permanent strength by
          up to 20x. This was the dawn of a new era. Expensive and dangerously strong magnets were now accessible to the
          public.</p>
        <p>Prices gradually fell in 2003 as international patents for Neodymium manufacturing began to expire, giving
          amateur hobbyists access to these unusually strong magnets in the comfort of their own homes. Powerful round
          magnets became commercially available for experimentation and amusement, unlike their block-shaped
          counterparts which were produced for their industrial utility.</p>
        <p>In late 2008, Hungarian mathematician Janos Szaki posted the first online video of his magnetic dot
          discoveries. With a background in mathematics and geometry, Szaki considered groups of magnetic dots as their
          corresponding shapes. While certainly not the first to evaluate shapes by their points, Szaki further applied
          the concept to forming 3-dimensional geometric structures and pioneered the online magnetic dot craze.</p>
        <p>This revelation took the world by storm. Szaki's videos became an instant viral hit and the community
          exploded, spawning fan groups and amazing new creations across the Internet.</p>
        <p>Seeing the product's potential, entrepreneur Tim Szeto teamed up with Szaki to perfect the spherical magnetic
          constructors. The first magnets, however, were flawed; they were weak, inconsistent and not engineered for
          prolonged use and abuse. But this was just the beginning.</p>
        <p>Together, Szaki and Szeto continued working on Nanodots. Size, strength and material options were all
          researched and debated at length. After dozens of iterations, the first Nanodots prototype was produced in
          December 2008. The developers, however, still weren't completely satisfied. Silver, gold and black editions
          were developed and the surface formulas were re-engineered for improved impact resistance and color lasting.
        </p>
        <p>Early in 2009 the first Nanodots were released to testers. Feedback was extremely positive. Encouraged, Szeto
          partnered with Denis Saveliev and formally founded the Nano Magnetics Research Labs. By the end of 2009,
          Nanodots were garnering rave reviews, winning industry awards and becoming top sellers worldwide.</p>
        <p>Today, Nanodots are sold all around the world and have been widely praised by popular media. Nano Magnetics
          holds the Guinness World Record for the Largest Magnet Sculpture consisting of 550,000 individual magnets
          weighing over 600 lbs (272 kgs).</p>
        <p>Nano Magnetics continues to develop innovative products that enhance and build upon the Nanodots line. While
          virtually all development takes place behind a wall of strict secrecy, Szaki, Szeto, and members of the
          Nanodots Developers Program continue to test and perfect the company's latest discoveries for future release.
