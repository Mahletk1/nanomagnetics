				<h2>Changes to Terms of Service</h2>

				<p>We reserve the right to make changes at any time to these terms of Service. Any modifications to the

				<h2>Safety Notice</h2>

				<p>Before using any product, review the instructions carefully, and if any doubts or questions remain,
					consult local professionals or authorities. Because local codes and regulations vary greatly, you
					should always check with local authorities to ensure that your intended use complies with all
					applicable codes and regulations. Always read and observe all of the safety precautions provided,
					and follow all accepted safety procedures. What follows are reminders, although not an exhaustive
					list, of safety measures you should be aware of when using our NanodotsTM magnetic micro
					constructors. They are not substitutes for your own caution, care, good judgment and common sense.
				</p>



				<p>General Safety Instructions:</p>

				<p>Proper use </p>



				<p>Although Nanodots are coated with several layers of metallic surface, they can still be damaged if
					excessive force is applied. Do not compress or exert excessive pressure on the magnets in order to
					prevent cracking or deformation. Avoid contact between the magnets and other hard metallic surfaces.
					Do not throw or snap together the magnets. Do not cut or grind the magnets as the magnetic material
					can ignite. To separate magnets, carefully slide them apart instead of attempting to pull them
					apart. Magnets can demagnetize other electronic products when placed in close proximity. Keep
					magnets away more than 15cm (6 inches) away from credit cards, software, or any other magnetic
					storage media. Do not drop the magnets. If dropped, make sure that no individual magnets have
					detached. Keep out of reach of children at all times.</p>

				<p>Contact with body </p>



				<p>If using our magnets for medical purposes and health benefits, please consult your doctor. People
					with pacemakers, insulin pumps and other medical implants or devices should consult their doctor
					before using or handling our magnets. Certain metal alloys can cause an allergic reaction from
					coming in contact with skin and especially internal organs. Never put magnets in your mouth and
					avoid contact with sensitive body parts.</p>

				<p>WARNING! Magnets sticking together or becoming attached to a metallic object inside the human body
					can cause serious or fatal injury – seek immediate medical help if magnets are swallowed or inhaled.
					Our magnets should not be used by children below 6 years old to avoid risk of accidental swallowing
					or injury.</p>

				<p>If any signs of irritation or allergic reaction appear from ordinary contact with the magnets,
					discontinue using the product. If symptoms continue, immediately contact a doctor or physician.</p>

				<p>Proper storage </p>



				<p>Nanodots magnets can be stored together without losing magnetic field intensity. If several magnets
					are being stored, they should be stored in attracting positions. Do not expose magnets to high
					temperatures - they may lose their magnetic properties in temperatures above 100°C (212°F).</p>

				<p>Due to strong magnetic fields, Nanodots can attract metallic dust and debris, which may be difficult
					or impossible to remove. Store magnets in closed containers, so that they don't attract metal
					debris. Do not put magnets in places where metallic dust is apparent or may arise, such as
					workshops, garages, tool boxes, etc.</p>

				<p>Proper disposal </p>



				<p>Occasionally it may be necessary for you to dispose of magnets. Please observe the following so that
					you protect the environment, and do not violate local, state or federal laws. If the magnets are
					magnetized, and you have the means of thermally demagnetizing them (by taking the magnet to its
					curie temperature) in a safe environment, then you should try and do this. If such means are not
					available, make sure to use some type of shielding (galvanized steel sheets work great) to line the
					boxes or containers that will be used. This will prevent the magnets from sticking to the disposal
					containers.</p>



				<h2>Disputes and Governing Law</h2>

				<p>Any dispute relative to the NML Site or use or inability to use the NML Site will be governed by the
					laws of the province of Ontario and the laws of Canada, without regard to its conflict of law
					provisions. Any dispute relating in any way to your visit to or participation on the NML Site shall
					be submitted to confidential arbitration in Toronto, Ontario, except that, to the extent you have in
					any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek
					injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state, province or federal court in the province of
					Ontario and Canada, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Arbitration
					under these Terms of Service shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the Ontario
					Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in
					any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no
					arbitration under these Terms of Service shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party
					subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration involving any other party subject to
					these Terms of Service, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. The United
					Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.</p>

					otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms of Service are not
